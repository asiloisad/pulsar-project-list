The Project list is a window that makes it easier to navigate through projects. The project file is located in the Pulsar configuration files under the name `project.cson`.

## Installation

To install `project-list` search for [project-list](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/project-list) in the Install pane of the Pulsar settings or run `ppm install project-list`.

Alternatively, run `ppm install bacadra/pulsar-project-list` to install a package directly from Github repository.

## Projects...

The project file must be a valid `.cson` file. The main file structure consists of a list of objects with the following keys:

* `title`: [string] the name of the project.
* `paths`: [list of strings] the list of paths that describe the project.
* `tags`: [list of strings] (optional) tags for the project.
* `scan`: [boolean] (optional) flag to include subfolders as projects.

Here is an example of `project.cson`:

```cson
[
  {
    title: "py-bacadra",
    paths: [
      "C:/bacadra/"
    ],
    tags: [
      "bacadra"
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Projects",
    paths: [
      "C:/Projects/",
      "D:/Projects/"
    ],
    tags: [
      "Projects"
    ],
    scan: true
  },
  {
    title: "Samples",
    paths: [
      "C:/Samples/"
    ],
    tags: [
      "Samples"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Shortcuts

In the `atom-workspace` space, the following commands are available:

* `project-list:toggle`: (default `F10`) opens the project list.
* `project-list:recent`: (default `Alt-F10`) opens the recent projects.
* `project-list:update`: manually update the projects list.
* `project-list:edit`: open the project configuration file.

In the `project-list` view, the following keymap is available:

* `Enter`: opens a new window with the selected project.
* `Alt-Enter`: closes the active window and opens a new one with the selected project.
* `Shift-Enter`: appends the selected project to the projects in the active window.

## Configuration

The `Preserve last search` config option is used from the `command-palette` package.
