## Installation

### Atom Text Editor

The official Atom packages store has been [disabled](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). To obtain the latest version, please run the following shell command:

```shell
apm install bacadra/atom-project-list
```

This will allow you to directly download the package from the GitHub repository.

### Pulsar Text Editor

The package is compatible with [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) and can be installed using the following command:

```shell
ppm install bacadra/atom-project-list
```

Alternatively, you can directly install [project-list](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/project-list) from the Pulsar package store.

## Project list

![project-list](https://github.com/bacadra/atom-project-files/raw/master/assets/project-list.png)

The Project list is a window that makes it easier to navigate through projects. The project file is located in the Atom configuration files under the name `project.cson`. The file must be a valid `.cson` file. The main file structure consists of a list of objects with the following keys:

* `title`: [string] the name of the project.
* `paths`: [list of strings] the list of paths that describe the project.
* `tags`: [list of strings] (optional) tags for the project.
* `subsQ`: [boolean] (optional) flag to include subfolders as projects.

Here is an example of `project.cson`:

```cson
[
  {
    title: "py-bacadra",
    paths: [
      "c:/bacadra/"
    ],
    tags: [
      "bacadra"
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "projects",
    paths: [
      "c:/projects/",
      "d:/projects/"
    ],
    tags: [
      "projects"
    ],
    subsQ: true
  },
  {
    title: "samples",
    paths: [
      "c:/samples/"
    ],
    tags: [
      "projects"
    ]
  }
]
```

In the `atom-workspace` space, the following commands are available:

* `project-files:projects-toggle`: (default `F10`) opens the project list.
* `project-files:projects-edit`: edits the project list in Atom.
* `project-files:projects-cache`: manually caches the projects.

In the `project-list` view, the following keymap is available:

* `Enter`: opens a new window with the selected project.
* `Alt-Enter`: closes the active window and opens a new one with the selected project.
* `Shift-Enter`: appends the selected project to the projects in the active window.
* `Alt-Q`: changes the query to the project file path of the selected item (does not hide the view).
* `Alt-S`: changes the query to the selection (does not hide the view).

## Recent list

![recent-list](https://github.com/bacadra/atom-project-files/raw/master/assets/recent-list.png)

In the `atom-workspace` space, the following command is available:

* `project-files:recent-toggle`: (default `Alt+F10`) opens the recent projects.

In the `recent-list` view, the following keymap is available:

* `Enter`: opens a new window with the selected project.
* `Alt-Enter`: closes the active window and opens a new one with the selected project.
* `Shift-Enter`: appends the selected project to the projects in the active window.
* `Alt-S`: changes the query to the selection (does not hide the view).

## Configuration

The `Preserve last search` config option is used from the `command-palette` package. The [file-icons](https://github.com/file-icons/atom) package is required for this functionality.
